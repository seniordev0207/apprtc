webrtc
======

This repository is for WebRTC demos.

Many of these examples use new browser features. They may only work in Chrome Canary and/or Firefox Beta, and may require flags to be set. 

For more information about WebRTC, we maintain a list of [WebRTC Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idl_NYQhllFEFqkGQOLv8KBK8M3EVzyvxnKkHl4SuM8/edit).

If you've never worked with WebRTC, we particularly recommend the 2013 Google I/O [WebRTC presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2HzZkd2A40).
