This folder contains the source code for building a websocket-based signaling server in Go.

To build the signaling server, first install the Go tools and setup the workspaces as documented in http://golang.org/doc/install and http://golang.org/doc/code.html.

Then clone the go net repository from https://code.google.com/p/go.net/ into $GOPATH/src/, so there is a $GOPATH/src/go.net folder.

Then copy the content of this folder into $GOPATH/src/. Build and run the signaling server by running
  >cd $GOPATH
  >go install collidermain
  >$GOPATH/bin/collidermain -port=8089 -tls=true

To run the tests:
  >go test collider
