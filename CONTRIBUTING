WebRTC welcomes patches/pulls for features and bug fixes.

For contributors external to Google, follow the instructions given here:

Google Individual Contributor License

In all cases, contributors must sign a contributor license agreement,
either for an individual or corporation, before a patch can be accepted.
Please fill out the agreement for an individual or a
corporation, as appropriate.

https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual

If you plan to add a significant component or large chunk of code, it
is recommended to bring it up on the discussion list
(https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/discuss-webrtc) for a design
discussion before writing code.

If appropriate, write a unit test that demonstrates your patch. Tests are the
best way to ensure that future contributors do not break your code
accidentally.

To change the WebRTC source, you must submit a pull request in GitHub. See the GitHub documentation here:

https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/

WebRTC developers monitor outstanding pull requests. They may request changes to
the pull request before accepting. They will also verify that the CLA has been
signed.
